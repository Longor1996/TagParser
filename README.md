TagParse

====

TagParse is a small leightweight parser for HTML-style documents.
The entire thing is written in Java.

As a matter of fact, the very first version was coded up within 4,5 hours out of pure boredom by Longor1996/L.K./Lars K.


You are free to do whatever you want to do with this!
But it would be nice if you give credit if you use it.

Have a nice day!



PS:
The TagParserTest-class is just for testing the parser, as the name says.
You should delete it if you actually want to use this parser.
